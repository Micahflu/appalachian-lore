              that would go forward to become one of the most notorious legends in American history made its maiden
              flight through the dense West Virginian hillside. </p>

                <p>On November 16, 1966 the Point Pleasant Register published the first story in a series of
                  many chronicling terrifying encounters with the ‘Red-Eyed Creature,’ ‘The Mason Bird-Monster,’
                  ‘The Night Rider In The Sky’ –  the Point Pleasant Mothman. This first article details the police
                  reports of two young couples who were driving along a winding road on the outskirts of town when they
                  noticed two red lights on the road up ahead. As they got closer, they noticed that what they were
                  looking at were not lights at all – but glowing red eyes, illuminated by their headlights. As the
                  creature came into view, it spread its enormous 10-foot wings and lifted itself into the night,
                  flying at over 100 miles an hour directly towards the vehicle. They raced towards the city, terrified
                  of the giant beast hovering above them, whose powerful wings beat down on the hood of their car like a
                  mallet striking a drum.</p>

                    <p>This first fateful encounter took place in the McClintic Wildlife Reserve, an EPA clean up area
                      established as a result of an abandoned TNT plant that was home to secret operations during WWII. “After
                      the war ended, the government basically just left everything there,” says Jeff Wamsley, lifelong Point
                      Pleasant resident and owner of the Mothman Museum. “It was a perfect haven for kids to go, you know… drag
                      racing and partying, that kind of stuff. That was a place that kids could go to outside of the city limits
                      and not have to worry about the police coming after them and things like that. But it was also kind of a
                      perfect haven for whatever this thing was.” This dangerous, remote area would become the location of over
                      100 reported Mothman sightings from November 1966 to December 1967, sending the small town of Point Pleasant
                      into nation-wide notoriety and raising the question: What secrets are hidden within the hollows? </p>

                  <p>In 1967, reports of strange sightings in the area surrounding Point Pleasant became so commonplace
                    that people began to fear leaving their homes at night. A town that once felt so welcoming, so safe,
                    now had its residents glancing over their shoulders at every turn. Televisions would emit strange noises,
                    dogs would disappear from their yards, empty stretches of road suddenly felt much longer, and much more
                    dangerous. Wamsley, a lifelong resident of Point Pleasant, remembers what it was like to be a curious kid
                    growing up in a town terrorized by a mysterious creature. He would ask questions, but would rarely get any
                    answers. “They didn't like talking about it,” he says, recalling conversations he had with some of the origina
                    witnesses. “They didn't like reliving their story.”  </p>

                  <p>The Mothman was last seen in Point Pleasant on Friday, December 15, 1967. A night that Point Pleasant, and
                    the world, will never be able to forget. The night of the Silver Bridge collapse.</p>

                  <p>The Silver Bridge, which connected Ohio and West Virginia via the Ohio River, collapsed under the pressure
                    of rush hour traffic, resulting in the deaths of 46 people. The collapse was credited to a single fault, a 0.1
                    inch crack, on a single eye-bar. To this day, it is still the deadliest bridge disaster in United States history.
                    The tragedy shocked the small town of Point Pleasant, and in their grief and confusion, people began to search for
                    answers. Theories began to arise, drawing connections between the mysterious creature that had been terrorizing
                    their town and the horrible tragedy that later befell them. Some believed it was an omen, a supernatural being
                    sent to warn them; and others believed it was a winged demon, the result of a curse placed on the land over 200
                    years ago, sent to bring misery to the town’s inhabitants. </p>

                  <p>Over half a century after the Mothman’s terrifying reign over
                    Point Pleasant,  his intrigue lives on. There are still people who fear going out at
                    night, still people searching for answers, and in some places, under the cold glow of
                    the moon, there’s still the feeling that you’re being watched. “Even 50 years later,”
                    Wamsley says, “I'll get emails of people saying, you know, ‘Hey, we saw something
                    the other night...something strange.’” And they aren’t alone. There have been numerous
                    reports of a large, winged creature, hauntingly similar to the one described in
                    hundreds of archived police reports in Point Pleasant, being spotted in numerous
                    cities all over the United States.</p>
