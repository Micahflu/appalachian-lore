            intrigue but it's also a visually beautiful earthen structure that draws thousands of people to visit it each year. The serpent mound is an official national historic landmark and the world’s largest serpent effigy in existence. National
            Geographic magazine refers to the mound as a “Great wonder of the Ancient World” and is referred to by Beth Jenkins, a representative from the Ohio historical society as “an Ohioan Gem." </p>

                <p>Serpent mound is documented to be over 1,400 years old and is made from clay, ash, stones, and the soil and grass that cover it. The mound stretches to an astonishing 1,376 feet in total length just a little longer than 4 football
                  fields. The massive like curves in the mound that give the mound its serpent like shape stretch about 800 feet. Beth mentions that there is a lot of mystery behind who constructed the mound. However, historians attribute the
                  creation of the effigy to Adena culture. The Adena people were a group of native Americans that existed between 1000 to 200 B.C. and are known for their captivating man-made earthen structures that can still be seen today. In 1848
                  Serpent Mound was discovered by E. G. Squire and Edwin Davis, the fathers of modern-day archeology. These men wrote <i>Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley</i> a book that focuses on the study and discovery of prehistoric native
                  and ingenious mounds and architecture. </p>

                  <p>The mound is believed to be of astronomical significance to the Adena tribe. The entire body of the serpent from head to tail is serve a purpose in time keeping. The head of the serpent aligns with the sunset of the summer
                    solstice while the tail aligns with the winter solstice. The three curves in the middle of the serpent’s body align with the summer solstice sunrise, the autumn equinox and spring equinox respectively. It’s wildly accepted among
                    historical professionals that study ancient cultures and effigy's, that the mound was used by the Adena tribe to track the time of the year. </p>

              <p>Serpent mound had still been used as farmland even after the landmark’s initial discovery in 1848. A barn and livestock sat atop the serpent structure with plowing damaging the surrounding area of the structure. Several years later
                in 1886 Fredrick Ward Putnam, an American anthropologist who had become enamored by the mound, had put efforts in place to preserve the and restore the mound. Putnam did so by buying several acres of the property and for a time the
                land was owned by Harvard University and then later gifted to the state of Ohio. In 1967 the Ohio historical society opened a Serpent Mound themed museum near the mound. The historical society had also constructed a path around the
                outside of the mound so that all who traveled to visit the structure would have an easier time walking along side it. </p>

                meditate in its presence, and often leave gifts and offerings for the mound in appreciation. The next time you’re in South eastern Ohio take the time to visit this magnificent structure that has withstood the tests of time and
