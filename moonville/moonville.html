                <p>Abandoned by its last remaining residents in 1947, Moonville was never a particularly
                  large community—at its peak in the 1870s it had a population of about 100 people. It
                  originated in 1856 along a strip of rail that ran through land belonging to Samuel Coe, who
                  had struck a deal with the Marietta & Cincinnati Railroad that allowed them to freely build
                  track through his land, and in exchange they would transport the clay and coal that could be
                  found on his property. Moonville was one of several areas settled to take advantage of these
                  mineral resources, however all of these settlements struggled with isolation due to their
                  remote location, often being most easily accessed by railroad connecting them. This convenient
                  shortcut, bypassing the hike through the hills and hollows, was a hazardous method of travel
                  as the track crossed several sets of trestles spanning over ravines and creeks, as well as
                  passing through the Moonville tunnel. Neither tunnel nor trestles were quite wide enough to
                  allow safe passage while a train passed by, and were just a little too long to get out of
                  the tunnel by the time you heard the train coming, which resulted in a number of tragic
                  deaths that gave rise to one of Moonville’s most lasting legacies: its ghosts. Likely due
                  to its captivating name and striking tunnel, it seems to have become the focal point for
                  many of the incidents that happened even in the surrounding miles of track. </p>

                    <p>One of Moonville’s earliest ghosts was commonly sighted by the crews of freight trains
                      in the 1890s, reportedly dressed in white robes and carrying a lantern (who’s come to be
                      known as the Ghost of Moonville). The specter’s lantern has led some to speculate the ghost
                      could be that of Frank Lawhead, an engineer who had been killed in 1880 along with the
                      engine’s fireman, Charles Krick, in a head-on collision with another freight train. There
                      are two other reports of fatal train wrecks around Moonville, an earlier one in 1874, another
                      collision of freight trains resulting in the death of a fireman, and one in 1938 when a
                      freight train ran into a rockslide west of the tunnel, killing the engineer. Train collisions
                      weren’t the only danger to their crews, however, and oftentimes for those employed as brakeman
                      the smallest mistake could be fatal (deaths reported in 1859, 1873, 1876, and 1884 of brakeman
                      falling under the wheels of their own trains, or being crushed between cars). </p>

                    a man who was potentially murdered but definitely run over by several trains before he
                    was found the next morning in 1886, who is said to sit on top of the entrance to the
                    Moonville tunnel and throw rocks at visitors walking into the tunnel. </p>

                    mid 1980’s, have been long since removed along with the bridges and trestles. A short walk
                    from the tunnel, down the rail trail, across Raccoon Creek, and up the hill a ways you can
                    still find the foundation stones of the old school house, and on the very top of the hill
                    are the last remaining headstones of a cemetery that was said to have been “buried full”
                    by a former resident of Moonville while being interviewed in 1977 by Rich Dahn, a historian
                    associated with the Moonville Rail Trail Association. The Moonville Rail Trail Association
                    is a non-profit organization that has been working since 2001 to convert the old rail line
                    into a trail for public use. They maintain the tunnel and the trail and are working to
                    replace the bridges to improve access to the trail, and in 2016 installed the Neil Shaw
                    Memorial Bridge across Raccoon Creek.</p>
