            “Majestic”. You’ll see next to it a building with stained glass windows and a marquee advertising its latest
            events. This 160-year-old building has watched time pass through Chillicothe and was even involved in one of
            the city’s most tragic events. This building is the Majestic Theatre.</p>

                People”,
                you’ll find a detailed description of the history of the building on East Second Street. In January of
                1809
                the newly built building began as the Bank of Chillicothe. Throughout the years, the building switched many hands and became many things. What was once a bank
                turned
                into a space that over time housed Roscoe’s School for Accounting, the International Order of Odd
                Fellows, as
                well as Baptist and Methodist church services.</p>

              <p>In 1952, the original building was lost to a fire and plans were made to rebuild the space into a grand
                hall.
                Construction commenced and by 1854, the building was finally completed. Theater and musical performances
                were
                held here and became known as the Masonic Opera House.

                It wasn’t until 1915 that the building became known as the Majestic Theatre, and no more than two years
                later
                did the building experience its bleak involvement in one of the city’s most devastating events.</p>

              <p>In 1918, Chillicothe’s military training base, Camp Sherman, was hit hard with the Spanish Influenza.
                Large
                amounts of people were dying every day and the camp had run out of space to take care of the dead. With
                this,
                many local buildings ended up being used as temporary morgues, including the Majestic Theatre.</p>

          <p>“[The Majestic] actually became a temporary morgue. So in the dressing rooms downstairs…they would actually
            have bodies stacked like cordwood.” Says Gene Betts, a board member for the Majestic and an on and off
            volunteer since 2000. In another of Medert’s books titled “Chillicothe, Ohio and the Great War 1914-1918”,
            it’s mentioned that the theater’s seats “were removed to make room for the coffins”. </p>

          <p>The stage of the theater was used for the embalming process. Part of this process includes draining the
            blood
            from the body and in this case, the blood was drained into what was known then as “Bank Alley”. After this
            tragic event, it would become known as “Blood Alley”. </p>

          <p>“If you say ‘Blood Alley’ to people in Chillicothe, they still know you’re talking about the alley right
            beside the Majestic” says Betts.

          <p>Along with the theater’s other reported paranormal instances, such as clapping from a supposedly empty
            balcony and the feeling of an unwelcoming presence in the dressing rooms, reports have been made of being
            able
            to see the ghost of a soldier lying on the stage. However, these reports and the building’s past haven’t
            deterred visitors. “I haven’t come across anybody that’s creeped out by it,” says Betts. “It is definitely
            an
            intrigue of the building, so I think it actually helps get awareness out about the Majestic, especially when
            we do our ghost walks…so we’ve embraced it.” The Ghost Walk is a fundraiser that’s held once a year and out
            of
            the 15 years it’s been carried out, the majestic has been has been featured at least 10 of the years. </p>

          <p>Today, the Majestic Theatre is very active. They host many tribute band events as well as comedy nights,
            plays, and occasional movies and workshops. The grim hand the theater played in the city’s past doesn’t
            bother
            patrons and even attracts some of them. So the next time you’re in Chillicothe, stop by one of the
            Majestic’s
            performances to experience the history and the fun, and see if you can spot the paranormal.
