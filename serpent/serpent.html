            <p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>n an unassuming small town of Adams County just north of Peebles, Southeastern Ohio, an area of Appalachia, lies rich settler history and the mysterious Serpent Mound. Adams County is a rural part of Ohio where you will not find as much hustle and bustle in the area rather farmland, tree topped hills, and vast expanses of plains that stretch into the horizon. The town is rather tranquil with slow pacing, being behind the times, and simpler living which the residents of the county take pride in. However, within this small slice of slow-paced midwestern living hides a mystic entity that supersedes recorded history and evokes awe and curiosity from all around the Earth.</p>

                    <p>Early residents of the Adams County area had no idea about the grand structure they lived upon. Before the mound’s initial discovery, the surrounding land and the mound itself had been used for agriculture with there even being a farm shed on top of the mound. Serpent Mound had been a hidden gem shrouded by overgrown vegetation and its beauty forgotten by time.  Around 1848 Chillicothe, Ohio residents, E. G. Squier a local journalist and Edwin Hamilton Davis, a medical physician set off to work on a book called, “Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi valley”. This book was a cornerstone in the development of the scientific discipline of Archeology. The focus of this book was the study and discovery of prehistoric native and ingenious mounds and architecture. Squire and Davis uncovered the legendary ancient structure that had evaded the eyes of man for centuries.</p>

                  <p>In the late 1880s Harvard University anthropologist and Cincinnati, Ohio resident Fredrick Ward Putnam had learned about Serpent Mound. Upon coming to the mound Putnam became amazed by the site and very attached to the land. It was Putnam’s initial steps to save the land that there are modern efforts to continue preserving the landmark. Money and funds had been raised by Harvard to purchase the land and the University had owned the site for quite some time and was eventually gifted to the State of Ohio.</p>

                  <p >The Serpent Mound is truly an Ohioan Gem and a monument that has persevered over the tests of time. Historians to this day haven’t been able to discover the indigenous people that had constructed the mound. From what is known is that the mound had been constructed around 300 B.C. and the landmark gets its name because it’s a 1,736-foot-long mound in the shape of a serpent. The head and tail of the serpent coil circularly and line up the sun during the summer and winter solstice respectively. The mound is not only a local Ohio sensation but famous all over the nation and is studied worldwide. Not much else is known about The Serpent Mound and mystery is the main appeal for visitors. </p>

                     <p class="padding-bottom">A large amount of people that visit the Serpent Mound often have different interpretations of the purpose of the mound and motives for visiting.  The site is a beautiful representation of manmade craftsmanship and the beauty of nature comes together as one perfectly to create a vision of awe for onlookers. Certain visitors feel a strong connection with the mound and will often walk along the path put in by the Ohio historical society, meditate in its presence, and often leave gifts and offerings for the mound in appreciation.</p>
