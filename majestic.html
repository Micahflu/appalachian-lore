                hands many times and became many things. What was a bank turned into a space that came to house Roscoe’s
                School for Accounting, the International Order of Odd Fellows, and even Baptist and Methodist church
                services.</p>

              <p>In 1852, the original building was lost to a fire and plans were made to rebuild the space into a grand
                hall. Construction commenced and by 1854, the building was finally completed. Theatrical and musical
                performances were held here and became known as the Masonic Opera House. It wasn’t until 1915 that the
                building became known as the Majestic Theatre, and no more than two years later did the building
                experience its involvement in one of the city’s most devastating events</p>

              <p>In 1918, Chillicothe’s military training base, Camp Sherman, was hit hard with the Spanish Influenza.
                The death toll climbed higher every day and the Camp ran out of space to take care of the dead. With no
                other alternative, many local buildings ended up being used as temporary morgues, including the Majestic
                Theatre.</p>

          <p>“[The Majestic] actually became a temporary morgue. So, in the dressing rooms downstairs…they would
            actually have bodies stacked like cordwood,” said Gene Betts, a board member for the Majestic and volunteer
            since 2000. In another of Medert’s books titled “Chillicothe, Ohio and the Great War 1914-1918”, she writes
            that the theater’s seats “were removed to make room for the coffins”. The stage of the theater was used for
            the embalming process. Part of this process included draining the blood from the body and in this case, the
            blood was drained into what was known then as “Bank Alley”. After this tragic event, it would become known
            as “Blood Alley”. </p>

          <p>Along with the theater’s other reported paranormal instances, such as clapping from a supposedly empty
            balcony and the feeling of an unwelcoming presence in the dressing rooms, reports have been made of being
            able to see the ghost of a soldier lying on the stage. However, neither these reports nor the building’s
            past have deterred visitors to the theater. “I haven’t come across anybody that’s creeped out by it,” said
            Betts. “It is definitely an intrigue of the building, so I think it actually helps get awareness out about
            the Majestic, especially when we do our ghost walks…So we’ve embraced it.” The Ghost Walk is a fundraiser
            that’s held once a year in Chillicothe, and the Majestic has been featured in the Walk for at least 10 of
            the last 15 years. </p>
          <p class="padding-bottom">Today, the Majestic Theatre is very active, hosting many tribute band events as well as comedy nights,
            plays, and occasional movies and workshops. The grim role the theater played in the city’s past does not
            seem bother patrons and even attracts some of them. So, the next time you are in Chillicothe, stop by and
            enjoy one of the Majestic’s performances to experience the real history of the city, and see if you can spot
            or sense the paranormal.</p>
